Amahi Android App
=================

This is an initial **basic prototype** of the Amahi Android app. It's not much more than basic test code to start bootstrapping the app.

The fastest way to get acquainted with what the app should do is to use the [Amahi iOS app](https://www.amahi.org/ios). Install it and login once to see what it is about, preferably with an iPad (iPod or iPhone works also).

The app is to be composed of the following views:
 * A login page for a username and password, using OAuth connecting to the Amahi OAuth API endpoint to login users
 * A view to see a list of Servers.
 * Once one is selected, the user should see a list of Shares (the shares in the user's Amahi server)
 * Once a share is selected, the user should see a list of files and folders in the share
 * Once a user clicks on a folder, the user recursively browses through files and folders in that folder
 * Once a user clicks on a file, the user should be able to stream (in the case of audio or video) the file or otherwise view the file (example: PDF, text, jpg/png/gif/etc. images).
